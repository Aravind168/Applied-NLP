Generated word2vec features for Amazon reviews dataset and compared with Google's pretrained word2vec model. The trained word2vec is not able to capture relationships as well as the pretrained word2vec but does capture similarities of words pertinent to the task better. Using the pretrained word2vec features, trained simple classifiers like a perceptron and SVM; Feedforward Multilayer Perceptron networks with features being fed either as an average or concatenation; Simple RNN, GRU and LSTM to predict rating value for a review. Compared the classifiers performances and also the impact of features (TF-IDF vs word2vec). All experiments are shown in PDF/.ipynb.
